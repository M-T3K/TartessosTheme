# Tartessos

A theme for anyone that enjoys a blueish/greenish feel in their editor. Generated after I decided I'm leaving VSCode.

## Gallery

These images show the usage of the theme with a variety of programming languages. Additional extensions may be required to support all the languages and features of my original VSCode installation, but once done, the color theme should be the same.

## Maintenance

I have decided to leave VSCode as my Main Editor due to how slow it is, and will probably switch to my own fork of [4coder](https://4coder.net/). There's also a (much more limited) version of the theme for 4coder, on its respective folder. 

Feel free to fork this repo as much as you like, and I hope it you enjoy using it!
