# Tartessos

A theme for anyone that enjoys a blueish/greenish feel in their editor. Generated after I decided I'm leaving VSCode.

## Gallery

These images show the usage of the theme with a variety of programming languages. Additional extensions may be required to support all the languages and features of my original VSCode installation, but once done, the color theme should be the same.

## Maintenance

I have decided to leave VSCode as my Main Editor due to how slow it is, and will probably switch to [4coder](https://4coder.net/). I will make a conversion of this theme to 4coder if that ends up being my choice. Thus, I will not be maintaining this repository. Feel free to fork it as much as you like, and I hope it you enjoy using it!
